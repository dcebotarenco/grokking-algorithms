Binary search is an algorithm; its input is a sorted list of elements.

Binary search returns the position where itâ€™s located. Otherwise, binary search returns null

Logarithms
How many 10s do we multiply to get 100? 
log 100 = 2

logs are fips of the exponential
10^2 = 100 : log 100 = 2
10^3 = 1000 : log 1000 = 3
2^3 = 8 : log2 8 = 3
2^4 = 16 : log2 16 = 4
2^5 = 32 : log2 32 = 5

1.1 log 128 = 7
1.2 ??
