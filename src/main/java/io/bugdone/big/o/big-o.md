Big O
How fast the algorithm is
Lets you compare number of operations
It’s not enough to know how long an algorithm takes to run—you need to know how the running time increases as the list
size increases.

O(n) vs O(log n)

Common Big O run times

log time - O(log n)
liniar time - O(n)
Quick sort - O(n * log n) - fast sorting
Selection sort - O(n^2) - slow sorting
O(!n) very slow - traveling salesperson

1.3 O(log n)
1.4 O(n)
1.5 O(n^2)

Arrays vs List
Reading O(1) | O(n)
Insertion O(n) | O(1)
Deletion O(n) | O(1)
